            <h2>2. Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Merge Fellas was born from a love for puzzle games and the exciting challenge of merge
              mechanics. We noticed that while merge games were becoming incredibly popular, many
              lacked the polish, depth, and engaging content that players truly deserved.
            </p>
            <p>Our team set out to change that by creating games that combine:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Intuitive and satisfying merge mechanics</li>
              <li>Beautiful, eye-catching visual designs</li>
              <li>Smooth, responsive gameplay</li>
              <li>Progressive challenges that keep you engaged</li>
              <li>Accessibility across all devices and browsers</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="section">
